pokedex

Features: This web app loads data from PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/) and displays a list of Pokemon on to the website. Users can click on the Pokemon buttons and the application will display details for each Pokemon including an image. 

This is my first major project for my web development coding bootcamp. It was an immersive introduction into the following technologies:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript 
JQuery 
Bootstrap
